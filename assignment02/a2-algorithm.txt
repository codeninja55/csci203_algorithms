Below is one possible algorithm describing how the Assignment 2 descrete event simulator could be implemented:

  ---- declarations ----

Server{
	// busy (or idle) flag
	// stats stuff
	// etc
}

Event{
	// event type
	// event time
	// time periods in primary and secondary servers
	// server number which created event
	// etc
}

  ----- globals -----

primary server array 
secondary server array
event priority queue (note: min event time has highest priority)
primary server FIFO queue 
secondary server FIFO queue


main()
      
	open file
	read num of primary and secondary servers
	initialize servers etc	

	read next customer arrival event from file and add a 'customer arrival event' to the event priority queue

	while there are more arriving customers in file or customers in servers  // main event loop

		get next event from event priority queue

		if event is a 'customer arrival event'
			if a primary server is available
				add a 'customer finish being served in primary server event' to the event priority queue
				read next customer arrival event from file and add a 'customer arival event' to the event priority queue
				if no more customer arrivals in file set flag
			else
				add customer info to primary server FIFO queue

		else if event is a 'customer finish being served in primary server event'
			set primary server's busy flag to false
			do service time stats
			if a secondary server is available
				add a: 'customer finish being served in secondary server event' to event priority queue
			else
				add customer info to secondary server FIFO queue

		else if event is a 'customer finish being served in secondary server event'
			set secondary server's busy flag to false
			do service time stats


		if secondary server FIFO queue is not empty and a secondary server is available
			get next customer from secondary server FIFO queue and
			add a 'customer finish being served in secondary server event' to event priority queue
			do fifo queue waiting time stats


		if primary server FIFO queue is not empty and a primary server is available
			get next customer from primary server FIFO queue and
			add a 'customer finish being served in primary server event' to event priority queue
			do fifo queue waiting time stats
		
	end while  //main event loop
	
	calculate and printout statistics

end main()
